# FiscionX

**FiscionX** is a modern and lightweight C++ framework built on OpenGL for game development. It offers out-of-the-box support for skinned and static 3D models, spatial audio, embedded GLB model loading, and a powerful shader system â€” all designed for fast prototyping and efficient runtime performance.

## âœ¨ Features

- **Static and Skinned Models**
  - Load and render both static meshes and animated characters with skeletal animation.
  
- **GLB 3D Model Loading**
  - Fully supports `.glb` files with embedded textures, animations, and materials.
  
- **Custom & Built-in Shaders**
  - Easily create your own GLSL shaders or use pre-made shaders included with the engine.
  
- **Spatial Audio with FMOD**
  - Immersive 3D sound support using FMOD for realistic audio positioning and effects.
  
- **Binary Caching System**
  - Models and shaders are cached in binary format for ultra-fast loading and reloading.

- **Multimedia Support**
  - Render **images**, **text**, and **videos** as part of your scenes with high flexibility.
  
- **Antialiasing**
  - Built-in antialiasing for clean, high-quality visuals.
