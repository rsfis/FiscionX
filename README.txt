In order to test, please have sure you've already installed Visual C++ Redistributables 2015-2019 (Which is included in this directory, right in vc_redist.x64.exe).

If there is any error about shader cache loading, clean up "cache/shaders", but don't delete the entire directory!

You can verify the source code in source directory. FiscionX is an library, and you can copy FiscionCore.h and core.cpp, shaders and cache directories and paste in other projects to use freely.

Thank You!
